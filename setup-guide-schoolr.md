# School'R — Setup & Run Guide

## Overview

School'R is a React application that uses a mock API workflow for CRUD operations during local development.

This documentation sample focuses on helping a developer clone, install, and run the project successfully in a local environment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`.


## Start the Mock API

Run `npm run mock:api` or `yarn mock:api`.

This starts the local mock API used to support CRUD workflows during development.

## Start the Application

In a separate terminal, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Troubleshooting Notes

- If the UI loads but project data is missing, confirm the mock API is running.  
- If a port conflict occurs, update the script in `package.json` or stop the conflicting process.  
- If CRUD changes do not appear, verify that the local mock API process started successfully.  

## Documentation Goal

This sample demonstrates clear setup guidance for a collaborative React project using a mock API workflow, with emphasis on:

- Prerequisite Clarity
- sStep-by-Step Setup
- Command Visibility
- Common Troubleshooting Points
